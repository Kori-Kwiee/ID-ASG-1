      <h2>About Alien Stage</h2>
      <p>
        The Alien Stage is a televised singing competition hosted by the
        Segyein, where their Human Pets perform musical numbers for a panel of
        alien judges and a vast extraterrestial audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The stakes are absolute: <br />
        losers are executed on the spot, while winners are granted temporary
        reprieve and the opportunity to advance to the next round. The ultimate
        prize other than survival is unclear, but it's speculated that it could
        be a form of ambiguous "freedom" or elevated status within the
        segyein-controlled society. For the segyein, the Alien Stage appears to
        serve multiple purposes. It is a form of public entertainment, which
        appears to sate the segyein's morbid fascination with human suffering,
        emotions and creativity. It may also serve as a way to reinforce segyein
        dominance, to discourage rebellion, and perhaps a perverse form of
        population control. For humans, it could serve as a twisted outlet for
        human ambition.
